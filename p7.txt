Exp@7- To understand Static Analysis SAST process and learn to integrate Jenkins SAST to
SonarQube/GitLab.
Installation of Jenkins
wget -q -O - https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable/jenkins.io.key
| sudo apt-key add –
sudo sh -c 'echo deb http://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stablebinary/ >
sudo apt update
sudo apt install Jenkins
sudo systemctl start Jenkins
sudo systemctl status Jenkins
To check firewall settings
sudo ufw allow
To set up your installation, visit Jenkins on its default port, 8080, using your server domain
name or
IP address: http://your_server_ip_or_domain:8080
You should see the Unlock Jenkins screen, which displays the location of the initial password:
In the terminal window, use the cat command to display the password:
sudo cat /var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword
Copy the 32-character alphanumeric password from the terminal and paste it into the
Administrator
password field, then click Continue.
When the installation is complete, you will be prompted to set up the first administrative
user. It’s
possible to skip this step and continue as admin using the initial password we used above,
but we’ll
take a moment to create the user.
After confirming the appropriate information, click Save
Click Start using Jenkins to visit the main Jenkins dashboard:
Sonarcube setup
docker run -d -p 9000:9000 sonarqube
login
Generate User Token
Now, we need to get the SonarQube user token to make connection between Jenkins and
SonarQube. For the same, go to Administration> User > My Account > Security and then,
from
the bottom of the page you can create new tokens by clicking the Generate Button. Copy the
Token
and keep it safe.

Jenkins Setup for SonarQube
Before all, we need to install the SonarQube Scanner plugin in Jenkins. For the same, go to
Manage
Jenkins > Plugin Manager > Available. From here, type SonarQube Scanner then select and
install.
Now, we need to configure the Jenkins plugin for SonarQube Scanner to make a connection
with
the SonarQube Instance. For that, got to Manage Jenkins > Configure System > SonarQube
Server. Then, Add SonarQube. In this, give the Installation Name, Server URL then Add the
Authentication token in the Jenkins Credential Manager and select the same in the
configuration.
